# the control means an IUIAutomation client. Hand-writing that COM vtable is ~400 lines where one wrong
# slot is an access violation, and this repo's first rule is that nothing may crash the pill. 5.1 ships
# UIAutomationClient in the GAC on every Windows install, so the whole client costs a process boundary
# instead — and a hang or crash out here cannot touch the notch.

# on it has to happen inside one uninterrupted run, with focus never leaving the browser.

# Pressing the toolbar's own downloads button beats sending Ctrl+J, and not by a little: a keystroke goes

# only to the process receiving input — which the pill does not always still have by the time this runs.
# Measured: with rights denied, the old path sent nothing, found nothing and left the user staring at an
# unchanged download. UIA presses the button whether or not the browser is in front.
#
# Chrome needs this for a second reason. Its Ctrl+J bubble never appears in the accessibility tree at all
# (measured: after Ctrl+J the only download-ish control anywhere was the toolbar button itself), while
# toggling that button puts a "Recent download history" window in the tree with the row inside it.
# The retry is not optional: a browser builds its accessibility tree only once a UIA client attaches, and
# attaching is what this script just did. The first sweep can come back with a handful of controls and no
# toolbar at all — measured here as "no downloads button" against an Edge window that plainly had one.
#
# For a $bubbleOnly browser none of this applies: the bubble it would open has no Cancel in it, so opening
# one costs a second and leaves a popup sitting over the user's screen that still has to be stepped around.
# The tree does have to be built before anything can be found, though, and attaching a UIA client is what

# ── strategy 1: walk keyboard focus ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This is first because it is the only one that works against a list that closes itself, and because the
# controls it needs may not be in the tree at all until focus reaches them. Measured on Edge: a descendant
# search over the downloads flyout returns the row as a Group with an Image, two Texts and a ProgressBar —
# and no buttons whatsoever. Tab into that row and 'Pause' and 'Cancel' appear as the next two focus stops,
# with the row's Group name spelling out everything it contains ("File icon report.pdf 24.0 KB/s - 7.5 MB
# of 60.0 MB, 37 mins left 12 Pause Cancel"). That is why cancel worked in Chrome and did nothing at all
# in Edge for so long: the control was never there to be found.
#
# Three things now stop this walk, all of them the same bug seen from different sides: it is a long series
# of blind keystrokes, and a keystroke only means what you intended while nothing else has moved.
#   * $bubbleOnly  - Chrome has no Cancel to walk to. Skipped outright, which is also what makes cancelling
#                    a download in a LONG list instant instead of one Tab per row.
#   * focus left   - if the focused element stops belonging to the browser, the Tabs are landing in someone
#                    else's window. Measured as the user clicking anything mid-walk.
#   * cursor moved - hovering a Chromium row moves focus on its own, so a walk that assumed it knew where
#                    it was is now several rows off and about to press Cancel on the wrong download.
# On any of them the walk just stops; the page strategy below needs neither focus nor foreground and is
# where Chrome was always going to end up anyway.
